This sometimes caused vehicle to understeer and go off road on sharp turns. Setting it to too small a value resulted in shudden shifts and overshoots. This also sometimes resulted in the car leaving the track"

    "* Order 3 : Best Results. I was able to achieve speeds upwards of over 80mph and smooth trajectories\n",
    "* Order 2 : Too Much understeer. Speed needs to be just right to even make one turn\n",
    "\n",
    "** A Common behaviour I observed was that for all orders of polynomials except for 3 is that at specific turns the speed would slow down to almost zero and the vehicle would get stuck in a local minima of sorts. Even for really poor parameters for order 3, I did not observe this problem. I'm yet to comprehend the source of this issue but I'm going over the lessons and additional reading one more time. **"
